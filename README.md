## üìé Requirements
* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)-v16 
* [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/)-v13


### üåê Main

- Discord bot's
  token `You should know why you need this or you won't go to this repo` [Get or create bot here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- Your ID `for eval (owners command). It's dangerous if eval is accessible to everyone!!!`





<!-- INSTALL -->
## üöÄ Installation from source
```
git clone https://github.com/SxMAbel/economyBot.git
```
After cloning, run an
```
npm install
```
* Start the bot with `node index.js`

*To snag all of the dependencies. Of course, you need [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. I also strongly recommend [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) as it makes testing *much* easier.



<!-- CONFIGURATION -->

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configurations
- edit in `src/config.js` or you can edit in `.env` 
```js
    token: process.env.TOKEN || "", // Your Bot's Token
    mongourl: process.env.MONGOURL || "", // Mongo database cluster login url here
    embedColor: process.env.EMBEDCOLOR || "#ff7f50", // Embed Color
    guildCreateLogs: process.env.GUILDCREATELOGS || "939505896780857384", // Channel ID of the channel to send when the bot is added to a server
    guildDeleteLogs: process.env.GUILDDELETELOGS || "939505897837834301", // Channel ID of the channel to send when the bot is removed from a server
    ownerID: process.env.OWNERID || "809213892857167942", // Your discord User ID
